    <h1>Master Sword Pedestal</h1>
    <p>You grip the sword's handle and ready your stance. You begin to pull upwards. At first, the sword does not budge, but as you feel your life force drain, the sword slowly lifts out of its pedestal. Just as the last of your life force is about to be drained, the sword's point is freed from the pedestal.</p>
